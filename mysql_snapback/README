SnapBack: Quiesces a MySQL server and uses ZFS to pull a backup
          by snapshotting both the database and log filesystems during
          the quiesced state. SnapBack is InnoDB aware/safe (sets 
          AUTOCOMMIT=0 before beginning). Also, it will record the 
          current master replication log file name and position in the
          ZFS snapshot name.
